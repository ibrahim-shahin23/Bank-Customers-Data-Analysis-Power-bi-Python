__Bank customers dashboard
I've developed a powerful data dashboard that can revolutionize your understanding of customers. 
This interactive tool delves into a rich dataset, revealing hidden patterns and trends about:
• Demographics: Age, job type, marital status, and education level
• Financial Standing: Credit default history, average balance, housing and personal loans
• Communication Preferences: Contact type (cellular or telephone) and preferred days/months for contact.
• Campaign Performance: Contact frequency, previous campaign results, and new campaign effectiveness
But wait, there's more! Our dashboard also highlights the crucial role of "duration," a metric that measures the length of customer interactions.
While not directly predictive, it provides valuable insights into engagement levels.
Key Benefits:
Deeper Customer Understanding: Gain a comprehensive view of your customer base to inform targeted marketing strategies.
Improved Campaign Effectiveness: Optimize campaigns by identifying peak contact times and preferred communication methods.
Data-Driven Decisions: Make informed choices based on concrete evidence and customer behavior
